## Overview
Week 6 and 7 focused on backend development using Java and Spring Boot. We started with understanding servlets and Tomcat, then moved on to building RESTful APIs using Spring. Key concepts like annotations, dependency injection, and multi-layer architecture were covered. By the end, we developed an Employee Payroll application with H2 database integration, demonstrating real-world backend service development.
